        A progression shaped by real systems, production responsibility,
        and learning how software behaves outside textbooks.

      <p>
        I started as an intern working across frontend and backend systems,
        learning how products are actually built and shipped.

      <p>
        Over time, my focus shifted toward backend-heavy systems where
        correctness, performance, and long-term evolution mattered.

        Today, I work on production systems where ownership, debugging,
        and trade-offs define day-to-day engineering.
